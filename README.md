# HappyNumbersChecker

This project includes a function called `happy_number` that checks whether a number is a **Happy Number** or not.  

### What is a Happy Number?  
A **Happy Number** is a number that, if we calculate the sum of the squares of its digits and repeat this process, eventually reaches **1**. Otherwise, the number is not happy.

For example, 19 is a happy number. Here's why:
- 1² + 9² = 82
- 8² + 2² = 68
- 6² + 8² = 100
- 1² + 0² + 0² = 1
